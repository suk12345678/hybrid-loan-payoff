        <section class="content">
            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>hey, it's jenny.</strong> ucsb student, working 3 jobs, figuring out loans bc nobody else is gonna do it for me. this is how to use the calculator to see which strategy actually works for you.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>ready to see the difference?</h2>
            <p>you've learned about avalanche, snowball, and hybrid. now it's time to see which one works best for <em>your</em> loans.</p>
            <p>the calculator at <strong>ItsYourIncome.com</strong> lets you compare all three side-by-side with your actual numbers.</p>

            <h3>what the calculator shows you</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>total interest paid with each strategy</li>
                <li>time to payoff with each strategy</li>
                <li>when each loan gets paid off</li>
                <li>monthly payment breakdown</li>
                <li>customizable hybrid strategies (drag and drop your own order)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>what you'll need</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>balance for each loan</li>
                    <li>interest rate for each loan</li>
                    <li>minimum payment for each loan</li>
                    <li>how much extra you can pay each month</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(basically just have your loan info ready. i use a google sheet bc i'm not fancy.)</p>
            </div>

            <h2>why even compare strategies?</h2>
            <p>the difference between strategies might be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HUGE</strong> — if you got high-interest debt, avalanche could save you literal thousands</li>
                <li><strong>minimal</strong> — if your interest rates are all similar, the cost difference is like $200. not worth stressing over.</li>
                <li><strong>somewhere in between</strong> — a hybrid approach might give you 90% of the savings with way better motivation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>you won't know until you run YOUR numbers. not some example. yours.</p>

            <h2>building a custom hybrid strategy</h2>
            <p>the calculator lets you drag and drop your loans into whatever order you want. it's actually kinda fun.</p>

            <h3>example hybrid strategies to try</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>quick win first:</strong> pay off smallest loan, THEN switch to avalanche</li>
                <li><strong>high-interest with breaks:</strong> tackle highest-interest, then knock out a small one for motivation, then back to high-interest</li>
                <li><strong>balanced:</strong> alternate between small balances and high interest</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>what if the numbers surprise you?</h2>
            <p>sometimes the "optimal" strategy isn't what you expect. here's what i've seen:</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>common surprises</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"avalanche only saves me $200?"</strong> — if your interest rates are close, snowball's psychological benefits are 100% worth the small cost</li>
                    <li><strong>"snowball costs me $2,000 more?"</strong> — if you got high-interest debt, avalanche is clearly better. the math doesn't lie.</li>
                    <li><strong>"a hybrid is almost as good as avalanche?"</strong> — YES. you can get 90% of the savings with way better motivation. this is the sweet spot.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>beyond just payoff strategy</h2>
            <p>the calculator also helps you explore:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>what if i pay an extra $100/month?</li>
                <li>what if i get a raise and can pay more?</li>
                <li>what if i make a lump-sum payment from a bonus?</li>
                <li>should i refinance to a lower interest rate?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <h2>try the calculator</h2>
                <p>compare avalanche, snowball, and custom hybrid strategies with your actual loans.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>after you run the numbers</h2>
            <p>once you've compared strategies, ask yourself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>how much does the "optimal" strategy actually save me?</li>
                <li>is that savings worth it if i'm less motivated?</li>
                <li>which strategy will i actually stick with for more than 2 months?</li>
                <li>can i build a hybrid that gives me both savings AND motivation?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>the best strategy is the one you'll actually follow</h2>
            <p>perfect optimization doesn't matter if you quit halfway through. i'm serious.</p>
            <p>choose the strategy that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>fits your personality</li>
                <li>matches your financial situation</li>
                <li>keeps you motivated</li>
                <li>you can sustain for literal years</li>
            </ul>
