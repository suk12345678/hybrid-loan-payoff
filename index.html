        <section class="content">
            <h2>The Standard Advice</h2>
            <p>When you search "how to pay off student loans," you'll find two strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Avalanche:</strong> Pay off highest-interest loans first (saves the most money)</li>
                <li><strong>Snowball:</strong> Pay off smallest balances first (builds momentum)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And then you're told to pick one.</p>
            <p>But what if neither one fits your situation?</p>

            <h2>The Problem with Binary Thinking</h2>
            <p>Real life is messy. Your loans are messy. Your financial situation is messy.</p>
            <p>You might have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One huge loan at 4% interest</li>
                <li>Three small loans at 6% interest</li>
                <li>A medium loan at 7% interest</li>
                <li>Variable income</li>
                <li>Other debts</li>
                <li>Psychological factors that affect your motivation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Forcing yourself into "avalanche" or "snowball" ignores all of this nuance.</p>

            <h2>What a Hybrid Strategy Looks Like</h2>
            <p>A hybrid approach combines the best of both methods based on <em>your</em> specific situation.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>Example Hybrid Strategy</h3>
                <p>You have 5 loans:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loan A: $15,000 at 3.5%</li>
                    <li>Loan B: $8,000 at 6.8%</li>
                    <li>Loan C: $2,000 at 5.5%</li>
                    <li>Loan D: $12,000 at 4.5%</li>
                    <li>Loan E: $1,500 at 6.0%</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Pure Avalanche:</strong> Pay off B first (highest interest)</p>
                <p><strong>Pure Snowball:</strong> Pay off E first (smallest balance)</p>
                <p><strong>Hybrid:</strong> Pay off E first (quick win), then B (highest interest), then C (another quick win), then D, then A</p>
                <p>Why? You get early momentum from knocking out E, then maximize savings by tackling B, then get another psychological boost from eliminating C.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>When to Use a Hybrid Strategy</h2>

            <h3>You Have Multiple Small Loans</h3>
            <p>If you have several loans under $3,000, knocking them out first simplifies your life and builds confidence—even if they're not the highest interest.</p>

            <h3>Your Interest Rates Are Close</h3>
            <p>If your loans range from 4% to 5%, the interest savings from pure avalanche are minimal. Balance size and psychological factors matter more.</p>

            <h3>You Need Motivation</h3>
            <p>If you've been struggling to stay consistent, early wins from paying off small loans can reignite your commitment.</p>

            <h3>You Have Variable Income</h3>
            <p>Eliminating smaller loans reduces your minimum monthly payment, giving you more flexibility during lean months.</p>

            <h3>You're Balancing Other Financial Goals</h3>
            <p>If you're also saving for a house, building an emergency fund, or paying off credit cards, a hybrid approach lets you balance multiple priorities.</p>

            <h2>How to Build Your Hybrid Strategy</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: List All Your Loans</h3>
            <p>Include balance, interest rate, and minimum payment for each.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Identify Quick Wins</h3>
            <p>Which loans could you pay off in 6 months or less with extra payments?</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Identify High-Cost Loans</h3>
            <p>Which loans have interest rates above 6%? These are costing you the most.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Create Your Order</h3>
            <p>Combine quick wins and high-cost loans in a way that makes sense for you.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Test It</h3>
            <p>Use a calculator to see how much interest you'll pay and how long it will take. Adjust if needed.</p>

            <h2>What You're Optimizing For</h2>
            <p>Pure avalanche optimizes for <strong>minimum interest paid</strong>.</p>
            <p>Pure snowball optimizes for <strong>psychological momentum</strong>.</p>
            <p>Hybrid optimizes for <strong>both</strong>—and for your specific life circumstances.</p>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>The Real Goal</h3>
                <p>The best strategy is the one you'll actually stick with.</p>
                <p>If pure avalanche feels overwhelming and you quit, you've saved $0.</p>
                <p>If a hybrid approach keeps you motivated and consistent, you win.</p>
            </div>
