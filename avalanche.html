        <section class="content">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The avalanche method is simple:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make minimum payments on all your loans</li>
                <li>Put any extra money toward the loan with the <strong>highest interest rate</strong></li>
                <li>Once that loan is paid off, move to the next-highest interest rate</li>
                <li>Repeat until all loans are paid off</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Why It's Called "Avalanche"</h2>
            <p>You're starting at the top (highest interest) and working your way down. Like an avalanche gaining momentum as it descends.</p>

            <h2>The Math Behind It</h2>
            <p>High-interest debt costs you more money over time. By eliminating it first, you reduce the total interest you'll pay.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>You have three loans and $500/month to put toward them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loan A: $10,000 at 7% (minimum payment: $116)</li>
                    <li>Loan B: $8,000 at 5% (minimum payment: $85)</li>
                    <li>Loan C: $5,000 at 4% (minimum payment: $46)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Avalanche approach:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pay minimums on B and C ($131 total)</li>
                    <li>Put remaining $369 toward A (highest interest)</li>
                    <li>Once A is paid off, attack B, then C</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Loans paid off in ~4.5 years, ~$2,800 in total interest</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Pros of the Avalanche Method</h2>

            <h3>1. Saves the Most Money</h3>
            <p>Mathematically, this is the most efficient way to pay off debt. You'll pay less interest than any other method.</p>

            <h3>2. Fastest Payoff (In Theory)</h3>
            <p>Because you're minimizing interest, more of your money goes to principal, which means faster payoff.</p>

            <h3>3. Logical and Straightforward</h3>
            <p>No guesswork. Just rank your loans by interest rate and work down the list.</p>

            <h2>Cons of the Avalanche Method</h2>

            <h3>1. Slow Initial Progress</h3>
            <p>If your highest-interest loan is also your largest, it might take years to pay it off. That can feel discouraging.</p>

            <h3>2. Requires Discipline</h3>
            <p>You won't see loans disappearing quickly. You need to trust the math and stay consistent.</p>

            <h3>3. Ignores Psychological Factors</h3>
            <p>Humans aren't purely rational. Sometimes we need wins to stay motivated, and avalanche doesn't prioritize that.</p>

            <h2>When to Use the Avalanche Method</h2>

            <h3>You're Motivated by Saving Money</h3>
            <p>If knowing you're minimizing interest is enough to keep you going, avalanche is perfect.</p>

            <h3>Your Highest-Interest Loans Are Manageable</h3>
            <p>If your highest-interest loan isn't overwhelmingly large, you'll see progress relatively quickly.</p>

            <h3>You Have Consistent Income</h3>
            <p>Avalanche works best when you can reliably make extra payments every month.</p>

            <h3>You're Good at Delayed Gratification</h3>
            <p>If you can stay focused on long-term goals without needing frequent wins, avalanche is ideal.</p>

            <h2>When NOT to Use the Avalanche Method</h2>

            <h3>You Need Quick Wins</h3>
            <p>If you're struggling with motivation, paying off a small loan first (snowball) might be better.</p>

            <h3>Your Interest Rates Are Similar</h3>
            <p>If all your loans are between 4% and 5%, the savings from avalanche are minimal. Other factors (like balance size) might matter more.</p>

            <h3>You Have Variable Income</h3>
            <p>If your income fluctuates, eliminating smaller loans first (to reduce minimum payments) might give you more flexibility.</p>

            <h2>Avalanche vs Snowball: The Numbers</h2>
            <p>Using the same example from earlier:</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>Comparison</h3>
                <p><strong>Avalanche:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time to payoff: ~4.5 years</li>
                    <li>Total interest: ~$2,800</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Snowball (smallest balance first):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time to payoff: ~4.7 years</li>
                    <li>Total interest: ~$3,100</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Difference:</strong> Avalanche saves ~$300 and finishes 2 months faster</p>
                <p>Is that worth it? Depends on your priorities.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How to Implement Avalanche</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: List Your Loans by Interest Rate</h3>
            <p>Highest to lowest. This is your payoff order.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Calculate Your Extra Payment</h3>
            <p>Total monthly budget for loans minus total minimum payments = extra payment amount.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Automate It</h3>
            <p>Set up automatic payments for minimums on all loans, then manually add extra to the highest-interest loan each month.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Track Your Progress</h3>
            <p>Watch your highest-interest loan balance decrease. Celebrate when it's paid off, then move to the next one.</p>
