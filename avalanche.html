            <p class="subtitle">does it actually work? let's talk about it</p>
        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>hey, it's jenny.</strong> ucsb student, working 3 jobs, figuring out loans bc nobody else is gonna do it for me. i researched all this stuff so you don't have to. this is what i learned about the avalanche method.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>ok so how does it work?</h2>
            <p>avalanche is pretty straightforward:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>make minimum payments on all your loans</li>
                <li>throw any extra money at the loan with the <strong>highest interest rate</strong></li>
                <li>once that one's dead, move to the next-highest interest rate</li>
                <li>repeat until you're free</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>why's it called "avalanche"?</h2>
            <p>you start at the top (highest interest) and work your way down. like an avalanche going downhill. idk who named these things but ok.</p>

            <h2>the math part (i'll keep it simple)</h2>
            <p>high-interest debt literally costs you more money every single day. by killing it first, you pay less interest overall. that's it. that's the whole strategy.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>real example with actual numbers</h3>
                <p>say you got three loans and $500/month to throw at them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>loan A: $10,000 at 7% (minimum: $116)</li>
                    <li>loan B: $8,000 at 5% (minimum: $85)</li>
                    <li>loan C: $5,000 at 4% (minimum: $46)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>avalanche says:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>pay minimums on B and C ($131 total)</li>
                    <li>throw the remaining $369 at A (highest interest)</li>
                    <li>once A is gone, attack B, then C</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>result:</strong> done in ~4.5 years, pay ~$2,800 in interest total</p>
            </div>

            <h2>the good stuff about avalanche</h2>

            <h3>1. you save the most money</h3>
            <p>mathematically, this is the most efficient way. you'll pay less interest than any other method. the math doesn't lie.</p>

            <h3>2. fastest payoff (in theory)</h3>
            <p>bc you're minimizing interest, more of your money goes to the actual loan balance, which means you're done faster.</p>

            <h3>3. it's logical and simple</h3>
            <p>no guessing. just rank your loans by interest rate and work down the list. easy.</p>

            <h2>the not-so-good stuff (real talk)</h2>

            <h3>1. progress feels SLOW at first</h3>
            <p>if your highest-interest loan is also your biggest one, it might take literal years to pay it off. that's... discouraging. like really discouraging.</p>

            <h3>2. you need serious discipline</h3>
            <p>you won't see loans disappearing quickly. you gotta trust the math and keep going even when it feels like nothing's happening.</p>

            <h3>3. it ignores how humans actually work</h3>
            <p>we're not robots. sometimes we need wins to stay motivated. avalanche doesn't care about your feelings lol.</p>

            <h2>when avalanche actually makes sense</h2>

            <h3>you're motivated by saving money</h3>
            <p>if knowing you're minimizing interest is enough to keep you going, avalanche is your thing.</p>

            <h3>your highest-interest loans aren't massive</h3>
            <p>if your highest-interest loan isn't like $50k, you'll actually see progress in a reasonable time.</p>

            <h3>you got consistent income</h3>
            <p>avalanche works best when you can reliably throw extra money at loans every month. gig economy life makes this harder.</p>

            <h3>you're good at delayed gratification</h3>
            <p>if you can stay focused on long-term goals without needing frequent wins, avalanche is perfect for you.</p>

            <h2>when avalanche is NOT it</h2>

            <h3>you need quick wins to stay motivated</h3>
            <p>if you're struggling to keep going, paying off a small loan first (snowball method) might actually be better for your mental health.</p>

            <h3>your interest rates are basically the same</h3>
            <p>if everything's between 4-5%, the "savings" from avalanche are like $200 over 10 years. not worth the stress.</p>

            <h3>your income is all over the place</h3>
            <p>if your income changes every month, knocking out smaller loans first gives you more breathing room when money's tight.</p>

            <h2>avalanche vs snowball: the actual numbers</h2>
            <p>using the same example from before:</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>real comparison</h3>
                <p><strong>avalanche (highest interest first):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>time to payoff: ~4.5 years</li>
                    <li>total interest paid: ~$2,800</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>snowball (smallest balance first):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>time to payoff: ~4.7 years</li>
                    <li>total interest paid: ~$3,100</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>the difference:</strong> avalanche saves ~$300 and finishes 2 months faster</p>
                <p>is that worth it? honestly depends on what keeps YOU going.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>ok so how do you actually do this?</h2>

            <h3>step 1: list your loans by interest rate</h3>
            <p>highest to lowest. that's your payoff order. done.</p>

            <h3>step 2: figure out your extra payment</h3>
            <p>total monthly budget for loans minus all the minimums = how much extra you can throw at the highest-interest one.</p>

            <h3>step 3: automate what you can</h3>
            <p>set up autopay for minimums on everything so you don't forget. then manually add extra to the highest-interest loan each month.</p>

            <h3>step 4: track it (or you'll lose motivation)</h3>
            <p>watch that highest-interest balance go down. celebrate when it's gone. then attack the next one.</p>

            <h2>what now?</h2>
