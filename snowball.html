                    <p><strong>hey, it's jenny.</strong> ucsb student, working 3 jobs, figuring out loans bc nobody else is gonna do it for me. i researched all this stuff so you don't have to. this is what i learned about the snowball method.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>ok so how does it work?</h2>
            <p>snowball is super simple:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>make minimum payments on all your loans</li>
                <li>throw any extra money at the loan with the <strong>smallest balance</strong></li>
                <li>once that one's gone, move to the next-smallest</li>
                <li>repeat until you're free</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>why's it called "snowball"?</h2>
            <p>like a snowball rolling downhill - you start small and build momentum. each paid-off loan frees up money to attack the next one, and you get faster as you go.</p>

            <h2>the psychology part (this is important)</h2>
            <p>paying off debt is HARD. it takes literal years. it's so easy to give up.</p>
            <p>snowball gives you frequent wins. every time you kill a loan, you get that dopamine hit that keeps you going. it's not about math - it's about not quitting.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>real example with actual numbers</h3>
                <p>say you got three loans and $500/month to throw at them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>loan A: $10,000 at 7% (minimum: $116)</li>
                    <li>loan B: $8,000 at 5% (minimum: $85)</li>
                    <li>loan C: $5,000 at 4% (minimum: $46)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>snowball says:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>pay minimums on A and B ($201 total)</li>
                    <li>throw the remaining $299 at C (smallest balance)</li>
                    <li>once C is gone (~17 months), attack B, then A</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>result:</strong> first loan GONE in 17 months, everything paid off in ~4.7 years, pay ~$3,100 in interest total</p>
            </div>

            <h2>the good stuff about snowball</h2>

            <h3>1. quick wins = you actually keep going</h3>
            <p>seeing a loan balance hit $0 is SO motivating. it proves you can actually do this. that feeling matters.</p>

            <h3>2. simplifies your life</h3>
            <p>every loan you kill is one less payment to track, one less servicer emailing you. less mental load.</p>

            <h3>3. lowers your minimum payments</h3>
            <p>each paid-off loan frees up its minimum payment. if money gets tight, you have more breathing room.</p>

            <h3>4. works with how humans actually work</h3>
            <p>we're not robots. we need encouragement. snowball gives you that.</p>

            <h2>the not-so-good stuff (real talk)</h2>

            <h3>1. costs more in interest</h3>
            <p>by ignoring interest rates, you'll pay more money over time compared to avalanche. that's just math.</p>

            <h3>2. takes a bit longer</h3>
            <p>bc you're not prioritizing high-interest debt, it takes slightly longer to pay everything off.</p>

            <h3>3. you gotta ignore the math</h3>
            <p>if you're someone who obsesses over optimizing every dollar, snowball might drive you crazy.</p>

            <h2>when snowball actually makes sense</h2>

            <h3>you need motivation to keep going</h3>
            <p>if you've tried paying off debt before and quit, snowball's quick wins can keep you engaged. for real.</p>

            <h3>you got multiple small loans</h3>
            <p>if you have like 3-4 loans under $3k, knocking them out quickly simplifies your life SO much.</p>

            <h3>your interest rates are basically the same</h3>
            <p>if everything's within 1-2% of each other, the "savings" from avalanche are tiny. snowball's psychological benefits are worth way more.</p>

            <h3>your income is all over the place</h3>
            <p>killing loans = lower minimum payments = more breathing room when money's tight. this is huge for gig economy life.</p>

            <h2>when snowball is NOT it</h2>

            <h3>you got high-interest debt</h3>
            <p>if you have loans at 8%+ interest, ignoring them costs you REAL money. avalanche or hybrid might be better.</p>

            <h3>you're super disciplined</h3>
            <p>if you don't need psychological wins to stay motivated, avalanche will save you more money. just facts.</p>

            <h3>your smallest loan is tiny but the next one is huge</h3>
            <p>if your smallest is $500 and the next one is $15k, snowball won't give you momentum for long. kinda pointless.</p>

            <h2>snowball vs avalanche: the actual numbers</h2>
            <p>using the same example from before:</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>real comparison</h3>
                <p><strong>snowball (smallest first):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>time to payoff: ~4.7 years</li>
                    <li>total interest paid: ~$3,100</li>
                    <li>first loan GONE: 17 months</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>avalanche (highest interest first):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>time to payoff: ~4.5 years</li>
                    <li>total interest paid: ~$2,800</li>
                    <li>first loan GONE: ~27 months</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>the difference:</strong> snowball costs ~$300 more but gives you a win 10 months sooner</p>
                <p>is that worth it? honestly depends on what keeps YOU going.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>ok so how do you actually do this?</h2>

            <h3>step 1: list your loans by balance</h3>
            <p>smallest to largest. that's your payoff order. done.</p>

            <h3>step 2: figure out your extra payment</h3>
            <p>total monthly budget for loans minus all the minimums = how much extra you can throw at the smallest one.</p>

            <h3>step 3: automate what you can</h3>
            <p>set up autopay for minimums on everything so you don't forget. then manually add extra to the smallest loan each month.</p>

            <h3>step 4: celebrate each win (seriously)</h3>
            <p>when you pay off a loan, CELEBRATE. then immediately redirect that payment to the next loan. keep the momentum going.</p>

            <h2>the "snowball effect" in action</h2>
            <p>here's why it's called a snowball:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>month 1-17: pay $299 extra on loan C</li>
                <li>loan C is GONE! now you have $299 + $46 (C's old minimum) = $345 extra for loan B</li>
                <li>loan B is GONE! now you have $345 + $85 (B's old minimum) = $430 extra for loan A</li>
                <li>your final loan gets absolutely crushed with massive payments</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>what now?</h2>
