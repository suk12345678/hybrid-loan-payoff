            <h1>The Snowball Method Explained</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Build momentum with quick wins</p>
        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The snowball method is simple:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make minimum payments on all your loans</li>
                <li>Put any extra money toward the loan with the <strong>smallest balance</strong></li>
                <li>Once that loan is paid off, move to the next-smallest balance</li>
                <li>Repeat until all loans are paid off</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Why It's Called "Snowball"</h2>
            <p>Like a snowball rolling downhill, you start small and build momentum. Each paid-off loan frees up money to attack the next one, and your progress accelerates.</p>

            <h2>The Psychology Behind It</h2>
            <p>Paying off debt is hard. It takes years. It's easy to lose motivation.</p>
            <p>The snowball method gives you frequent wins. Each time you eliminate a loan, you get a psychological boost that keeps you going.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>You have three loans and $500/month to put toward them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loan A: $10,000 at 7% (minimum payment: $116)</li>
                    <li>Loan B: $8,000 at 5% (minimum payment: $85)</li>
                    <li>Loan C: $5,000 at 4% (minimum payment: $46)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Snowball approach:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pay minimums on A and B ($201 total)</li>
                    <li>Put remaining $299 toward C (smallest balance)</li>
                    <li>Once C is paid off (~17 months), attack B, then A</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> First loan paid off in 17 months, all loans paid off in ~4.7 years, ~$3,100 in total interest</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Pros of the Snowball Method</h2>

            <h3>1. Quick Wins Build Momentum</h3>
            <p>Seeing a loan balance hit $0 is incredibly motivating. It proves you can do this.</p>

            <h3>2. Simplifies Your Life</h3>
            <p>Every loan you eliminate is one less payment to track, one less account to manage.</p>

            <h3>3. Reduces Minimum Payments</h3>
            <p>Each paid-off loan frees up its minimum payment, giving you more flexibility if money gets tight.</p>

            <h3>4. Works with Human Psychology</h3>
            <p>We're not robots. We need encouragement. Snowball provides it.</p>

            <h2>Cons of the Snowball Method</h2>

            <h3>1. Costs More in Interest</h3>
            <p>By ignoring interest rates, you'll pay more over the life of your loans compared to avalanche.</p>

            <h3>2. Takes Slightly Longer</h3>
            <p>Because you're not prioritizing high-interest debt, it takes a bit longer to pay everything off.</p>

            <h3>3. Requires Ignoring the Math</h3>
            <p>If you're someone who obsesses over optimizing every dollar, snowball might frustrate you.</p>

            <h2>When to Use the Snowball Method</h2>

            <h3>You Need Motivation</h3>
            <p>If you've tried paying off debt before and quit, snowball's quick wins can keep you engaged.</p>

            <h3>You Have Multiple Small Loans</h3>
            <p>If you have several loans under $3,000, knocking them out quickly simplifies your financial life.</p>

            <h3>Your Interest Rates Are Similar</h3>
            <p>If all your loans are within 1-2% of each other, the interest savings from avalanche are minimal. Snowball's psychological benefits outweigh the small cost difference.</p>

            <h3>You Have Variable Income</h3>
            <p>Eliminating loans reduces your minimum monthly payment, giving you breathing room during lean months.</p>

            <h2>When NOT to Use the Snowball Method</h2>

            <h3>You Have High-Interest Debt</h3>
            <p>If you have loans at 8%+ interest, the cost of ignoring them can be significant. Avalanche or hybrid might be better.</p>

            <h3>You're Highly Disciplined</h3>
            <p>If you don't need psychological wins to stay motivated, avalanche will save you more money.</p>

            <h3>Your Smallest Loan Is Tiny</h3>
            <p>If your smallest loan is $500 and your next-smallest is $15,000, snowball won't give you momentum for long.</p>

            <h2>Snowball vs Avalanche: The Numbers</h2>
            <p>Using the same example from earlier:</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>Comparison</h3>
                <p><strong>Snowball:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time to payoff: ~4.7 years</li>
                    <li>Total interest: ~$3,100</li>
                    <li>First loan paid off: 17 months</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Avalanche:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time to payoff: ~4.5 years</li>
                    <li>Total interest: ~$2,800</li>
                    <li>First loan paid off: ~27 months</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Difference:</strong> Snowball costs ~$300 more but gives you a win 10 months sooner</p>
                <p>Is that worth it? Depends on what keeps you motivated.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How to Implement Snowball</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: List Your Loans by Balance</h3>
            <p>Smallest to largest. This is your payoff order.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Calculate Your Extra Payment</h3>
            <p>Total monthly budget for loans minus total minimum payments = extra payment amount.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Automate It</h3>
            <p>Set up automatic payments for minimums on all loans, then manually add extra to the smallest loan each month.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Celebrate Each Win</h3>
            <p>When you pay off a loan, acknowledge it. Then immediately redirect that payment to the next loan.</p>

            <h2>The "Snowball Effect" in Action</h2>
            <p>Here's why it's called a snowball:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Month 1-17: Pay $299 extra on Loan C</li>
                <li>Loan C paid off! Now you have $299 + $46 (C's old minimum) = $345 extra for Loan B</li>
                <li>Loan B paid off! Now you have $345 + $85 (B's old minimum) = $430 extra for Loan A</li>
                <li>Your final loan gets crushed with massive payments</li>
            </ul>
